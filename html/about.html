                        <p> I was born in St. Charles in September of 1977. By 1980, we eventually moved to St. Peters,
                            where I went to until 1986. I had a few friends and like usual lost contact with them. One
                            of my biggest memories while living there was, watching on tv, the space shuttle taking off
                            and exploding into pieces. At the time, we though that it was supposed to make a spectacular
                            show, but it wasn't until later we found out that it was not the case.

                    <p>In 1986 we move to Carterville. With a population of around 5000 people in the town it was a
                        cultural bombshell. Carterville is about halfway between Marion, right off I-57, and Carbondale.
                        Carbondale, being a college town, is home to Southern Illinois University. Home of the Salukis.
                        During my time in Carterville, my dad and I went to a few of SIU football and basketball games.
                    While living here, I graduated from 8th grade. In 1991 we moved to Kentucky.

                    <p>In 1991 we moved to Louisville where I have remained today. I started high school here. First at
                        Eastern High School, then finally graduating at Trinity. Like everyone else, we are spread away
                        from each other with my older sister and her husband living in North Carolina. While living here
                        I have gone to multiple University of Louisville football and basketball games as well as
                        numerous minor league baseball and hockey games. as well as traveling to Cincinatti,
                        Indianapolis, St. Louis, and many other cities and towns for MLB, NFL, MiLB, and independent
                        baseball games. As well as a few NFL games and a few Indy 500 races. Living here I have also
                        been to Churchill Downs for a few horse races as well as one Kentucky Derby.
