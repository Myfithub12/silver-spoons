# silver-spoons

This program is dedicated to my liking of baseball. I have been following it for years as well as sport card collecting since 1985. Although I have not included any cards or memorability into this projact, I might add a few at a later time.
In this program I have included a flex box for adjusting from computer moniter to cell phone, java script, and various components of css and html that link ny 3 pages of this program, as well as external links of reference to an outside source. I also have linked my personal information to the project.
